#  P3
After working in Ruby on Rails for a while, and eventually swithing back to PHP, I wanted to build my apps using the MVC paradigm.  Obviously, there are tons of great Frameworks to choose from.  But I believe P3 offers competitive features that everyone could enjoy

## Special thanks to BigE
P3 was inspired by SiTech, a library built by a good friend of mine, BigE.  SiTech is a Library designed for the coder who wants some functinonality of a Framework, without being forced into using the entire package.  Each piece of SciTech runs completely independent of eachother, with a few exceptions of course, making it infiinitely versatile.  P3 stemmed from SiTechs Models/Controllers, and grew into a borderline Rails Clone.
